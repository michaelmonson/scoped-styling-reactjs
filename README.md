# scoped-styling-reactjs
### This quick ReactJS project demonstrates how to scope styling to specific React Components. 

By default, CSS classes are globally available.  This demonstrates how to scope it!

Building web apps with React is not just about composing components together and making sure that the logic works correctly.  Building React apps is _also_ about **styling** those apps.

There are different techniques for setting styles dynamically, and for styling components such that other components are _not affected_ by a specific component's styles.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how you can set up styles in a conditional or dynamic way.  How you can switch certain styles based on some conditions.

This sample ReactJS App will show two popular approaches for scoping styles to specific components, such that they only affect the component and are _not_ added as global styles.
  - We'll have a look at styled components, which is a third-party library, a very popular one, allowing us to set up pre-styled components with their own scoped styles.
  - We'll introduce and play with a concept called CSS modules.
  - Learn what these different approaches are, how to work with them, and to use them within a ReactJS project.

A zipped copy of the starter project, and the completed project, both without the node modules and other dependencies will be included once this project is complete.
  - If you want to run it on your own system, you can start by downloading either version.
  - Simply opened a terminal, navigate into this project folder, and to run NPM install.
  - This will install all the third-party packages which are required since neither zipped project comes with a [**node modules**] folder
  - This is because that would unnecessarily bloat the ZIP file.

If you are new to these kinds of projects, running an '**npm install**' simply installs all packages and recreates the node modules folder.
Once the project has been extracted and installed on your machine, you can start it by running NPM start.
By starting the development server, you can play around with either project.

**_Have fun!_**
